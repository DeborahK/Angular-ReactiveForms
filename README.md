# Angular Reactive Forms
Materials for my Pluralsight course: ["Angular Reactive Forms"](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-2-reactive-forms).

`Demo-Start`: The starter files. **Use this to code along with the course**.

`Demo-Final`: The completed files. Use this to see the completed solution from the course.

`APM`: Angular reactive form in the context of a more full-featured application. Includes examples of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations.

Angular v12 turns strict typing on by default. Angular forms is not very strongly typed, so some changes are required to support strict typing. Use these files if you are using Angular v12 or newer or if you turn on strict typing.
